// TOP LEVEL FEATURES
- [X] In-chunk face optimization - remove faces that are all unseen
- [X] Chunk-loading animation -- later removed for performance
- [X] Multiple block types
- [X] Chunk manager
- [X] Stable Cascaded shadow maps
- [X] Moving Clouds
- [X] Celestial Bodies - Sun, Moon, Stars
- [X] Dynamic "SkyBox" showing Day-Night cycle
- [] Fancy Water
- [] Better World generation
- [] Ambient Occlusion -- Optional
- [] Placing/Destroying blocks
- [] Proper documentation in README.md

// LOW LEVEL IMPROVEMENTS
- [X] Move view and perspective transforms to a Uniform Buffer Object
- [X] Figure out a dynamic way of specifying a "Vertex" for a Buffer
- [X] Add a trait for all types of vertex, directly specifying the data layout inside the vertex type
- [X] Optimize chunk meshing, implement greedy meshing
- [] Optimize chunk generation speed
- [] Optimize chunk storage space
- [] Gpu frustum culling
- [] Try timing pers mapping vs mapping a single section each time
- [] Try writing the chunks's Meshes into the persistent buffer directly, not storing a copy first in RAM

// ISSUES
- [] Clouds too visible during the night, not affected by lighting
- [] Pressing X while chunks are being loaded takes too long to exit
- [] Fix alloc - dealloc
- [] Fix loaded no visible
